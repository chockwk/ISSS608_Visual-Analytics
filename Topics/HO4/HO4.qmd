2.  Create visual graphics with **rich statistical information** using `ggstatsplot` package

3.  Visualise **uncertainty** using `ungeviz` package

# 2. Load Packages

-   `tidyverse` is a family of R packages designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs

-   `ggridges` is an ggplot2 extension specially designed for plotting ridgeline plots

-   `ggdist` is an ggplot2 extension for visualising distribution and uncertainty

-   `ggthemes` and `colourspace`

-   `ggstatsplot` is an ggplot2 extension for creating graphics with details from statistical tests

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, ggridges, ggdist, ggthemes, colorspace, ggstatsplot, ungeviz, crosstalk, plotly, DT, gganimate)
```

# 3. Import Data

exam_data is a year end examination grades of a cohort of Primary 3 students from a local school.

```{r}
exam_data <- read.csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
glimpse(exam_data)
```

# 4. Ridgeline Plot

A Ridgeline plot (or Joyplot) shows the distribution of a **numeric** value for **several groups/variables**. Distribution can be represented using **histograms** or **density plots**, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap.

Ridgeline plots are useful to represent **medium to high groups (above 6)**, and overlapping groups use space more efficiently. Where there is less than 6 groups, distribution plots are better, namely violin, density, histogram and boxplot.

Ridgeline plots works well with **clear patterns or ranking** in the data. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.

`ggridges` package provides two main geom to plot gridgeline plots:

1.  `geom_ridgeline()` takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines

2.  `geom_density_ridges()` estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines

::: panel-tabset
## Density Plot

The `geom_density_ridges()` calculates density estimates from the data and then plots those, using the ridgeline visualization. The `height` aesthetic does not need to be specified in this case.

Trailing tails can be cut off using the `rel_min_height` aesthetic. This aesthetic sets a percent cutoff relative to the highest point of any of the density curves. A value of **0.01** usually works well, but you may have to modify this parameter for different datasets.

The extent to which the different densities overlap can be controlled with the `scale` parameter. A setting of scale = **1** means the tallest density curve just touches the baseline of the next higher one. Smaller values create a separation between the curves, and larger values create more overlap.

```{r}
ggplot(exam_data, 
       aes(x = ENGLISH, y = CLASS)) +
  geom_density_ridges(scale = 3,
                      alpha = 0.3,
                      rel_min_height = 0.01,
                      scale = 1,
                      bandwidth = 3.4,
                      aes(fill = CLASS))+
  scale_x_continuous(name = "English Scores",
                     expand = c(0, 0))+
  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2,2.6)))+
  theme_ridges()
```

## Histogram

A ridgeline plot can also be created using a set of **histograms** using `stat` and `bins` aesthetics.

```{r}
ggplot(exam_data, 
       aes(x = ENGLISH, y = CLASS, fill = CLASS))+
  geom_density_ridges(scale = 2.5,
                      alpha = 0.3,
                      stat = "binline",
                      bins = 20,
                      rel_min_height = 0.01,
                      scale = 1,
                      bandwidth = 3.4,
                      aes(fill = CLASS))+
  scale_x_continuous(name = "English Scores",
                     expand = c(0, 0))+
  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2,2.6)))+
  theme_ridges()
```

## Density Plot with Gradient

Instead of a single solid color, the area under a ridgeline can be filled with colors that vary in some form along the x axis using `geom_ridgeline_gradient()` or `geom_density_ridges_gradient()`. Both geoms work just like geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(), except that they allow for varying fill colors.

However, they do not allow for `alpha` transparency for technical reasons.

`direction` sets the order of colors in the scale. If 1, the default, colors are ordered from darkest to lightest. If -1, the order of colors is reversed.

`option` is a character string indicating the color map option to use. Eight options are available:

"magma" (or "A") "inferno" (or "B") "plasma" (or "C") "viridis" (or "D") "cividis" (or "E") "rocket" (or "F") "mako" (or "G") "turbo" (or "H")

```{r}
ggplot(exam_data, 
       aes(x = ENGLISH, y = CLASS,
           fill = stat(x)))+
  geom_density_ridges_gradient(scale = 3,
                               bandwidth = 3.4,
                               rel_min_height = 0.01)+
  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = "English Scores",
                       option = "D") +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "English Scores",
                     expand = c(0, 0))+
  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6)))+
  theme_ridges()
```

## Density Plot with Probabilities

`ggridges` also provides a stat function, `stat_density_ridges()` to replace `stat_density()` of ggplot2, where **calc_ecdf = TRUE**.

The probabilities are calculated by using `stat(ecdf)` which represent the **empirical cumulative density function** for the distribution of English score.

```{r}
ggplot(exam_data,
       aes(x = ENGLISH, y = CLASS, 
           fill = 0.5 - abs(0.5-stat(ecdf))))+
  stat_density_ridges(geom = "density_ridges_gradient", 
                      calc_ecdf = TRUE,
                      scale = 2,
                      bandwidth = 3.4)+
  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = "Tail probability",
                       direction = -1,
                       option = "A")+
  theme_ridges()
```

## Density Plot with Quantiles

The ridgeline plot can be coloured by **quantile** using the calculated `stat(quantile)` aesthetic, where **calc_ecdf = TRUE**, **quantiles = \#** and **quantile_lines = TRUE**.

```{r}
ggplot(exam_data,
       aes(x = ENGLISH, y = CLASS, 
           fill = factor(stat(quantile))))+
  stat_density_ridges(geom = "density_ridges_gradient",
                      scale = 2,
                      bandwidth = 3.4,
                      calc_ecdf = TRUE, 
                      quantiles = 5,
                      quantile_lines = TRUE)+
  scale_fill_viridis_d(name = "Quartiles",
                       direction = -1,
                       option = "A")+
  theme_ridges()
```

## Density Plot with Confidence Intervals

Instead of using number to define the quantiles, we can also specify quantiles by **cut points** such as 2.5% and 97.5% tails to colour the ridgeline plot.

```{r}
ggplot(exam_data,
       aes(x = ENGLISH, y = CLASS, 
           fill = factor(stat(quantile))))+
  stat_density_ridges(geom = "density_ridges_gradient",
                      scale = 2,
                      bandwidth = 3.4,
                      calc_ecdf = TRUE,
                      quantiles = c(0.025, 0.975))+
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Probability",
                    values = c("#FF0000A0", "#A0A0A0A0", "#0000FFA0"),
                    labels = c("(0, 0.025]", "(0.025, 0.975]", "(0.975, 1]"))+
  theme_ridges()
```

# 5. Raincloud Plot

The Raincloud Plot is a visualization that produces a **half-density** to a distribution plot. The density plot is in the shape of a raincloud and enhances the the box-plot by highlighting multiple modalities (an indicator that groups may exist).

The boxplot does not show where densities are clustered, but the raincloud plot does. Step 1: Plot a Half-Eye graph by using `stat_halfeye()` of ggdist package Step 2: Add the second geometry layer using `geom_boxplot()` of ggplot2 Step 3: Add the third geometry layer using `stat_dots()` of ggdist package Step 4: Flip the raincloud chart horizontally using `coord_flip()` of ggplot2 package

::: panel-tabset
## Half Eye

`stat_halfeye()` of ggdist package produces a Half Eye visualization, which is contains a half-density and a slab-interval.

The slab interval is removed by setting **.width = 0** and **point_colour = NA**.

```{r}
ggplot(exam_data, 
       aes(x = RACE, y = ENGLISH, fill = GENDER)) +
  stat_halfeye(alpha = 0.5,
               adjust = 0.5,
               justification = -0.2,
               .width = 0,
               point_colour = NA)+
  theme_minimal()
```

## Boxplot

`geom_boxplot()` of ggplot2 produces a narrow boxplot. The width and opacity can be adjusted.

```{r}
ggplot(exam_data, 
       aes(x = RACE, y = ENGLISH, fill = GENDER))+
  stat_halfeye(alpha = 0.5,
               adjust = 0.5,
               justification = -0.2,
               .width = 0,
               point_colour = NA)+
  geom_boxplot(width = .20, 
               outlier.shape = NA,
               alpha = 0.8)+
  theme_minimal()
```

## Dot Plot

`stat_dots()` of ggdist package produces a half-dotplot, which is similar to a histogram. The number of dots that indicates the number of data points in each bin.

**side = “left”** indicates the position of dots on the left-hand side.

```{r}
ggplot(exam_data, 
       aes(x = RACE, y = ENGLISH, fill = GENDER)) +
  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,
               justification = -0.2,
               .width = 0,
               point_colour = NA,
               alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_boxplot(width = .20,
               outlier.shape = NA,
               alpha = 0.8) +
  stat_dots(side = "left", 
            justification = 1.2, 
            binwidth = .5,
            dotsize = 2)+
  theme_minimal()
```

## Flip

`coord_flip()` of ggplot2 package flips the raincloud chart horizontally to give it the raincloud appearance.

Optional: `theme_economist()` of ggthemes package is used to give the raincloud chart a professional publishing standard look.

```{r}
ggplot(exam_data, 
       aes(x = RACE, 
           y = ENGLISH, fill = GENDER))+
  stat_halfeye(alpha = 0.5, 
               adjust = 0.5,
               justification = -0.2,
               .width = 0,
               point_colour = NA)+
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.8, 
               width = .20,
               outlier.shape = NA)+
  stat_dots(side = "left", 
            justification = 1.2, 
            binwidth = .5,
            dotsize = 1.5)+
  coord_flip()+
  theme_minimal()
```

# 6. Statistical Tests

`ggstatsplot` is an extension of ggplot2 package for creating graphics with details from **statistical tests** to be included in the information-rich plots themselves.

-   Provide **alternative statistical inference** methods by default.

-   Follow **best practices** for statistical reporting. The default template abides by the APA gold standard for statistical reporting.

## 6.1 One-sample Test

`gghistostats` can be used for data exploration to **inspect distribution of a continuous variable** and to test if the **mean** of a sample variable is different from a specified value (population parameter).

::: {.callout-tip}
### Bayes factor
**Bayes factor** is **the ratio of the likelihood** of one particular hypothesis to the likelihood of another. It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories. A Bayes Factor can be any **positive number**.

It gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.

When comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as **B10**.
:::

`gghistostats` computed **Bayes Factors** to quantify the likelihood of the English Score (BF10) and the null hypothesis (BF01). In our example, the Bayes Factor value indicates these English scores are similar to the population mean generated from **set.seed(1234)**. The log(Bayes factor) of 31.45 means the odds are low that this sample is different.

```{r}
set.seed(1234)

gghistostats(data = exam_data,
             x = ENGLISH,
             type = "bayes",
             test.value = 60,
             xlab = "English Scores")
```

## 6.2 Two-sample mean test

ggbetweenstats() is used to build a visual for two-sample mean test of Maths scores by gender.

```{r}
ggbetweenstats(
  data = exam_data,
  x = GENDER, 
  y = MATHS,
  type = "np",
  messages = FALSE
)
```

## 6.2 One-way ANOVA Test

ggbetweenstats() is used to build a visual for One-way ANOVA test on English score by race.

```{r}
ggbetweenstats(data = exam_data,
               x = RACE, 
               y = ENGLISH,
               type = "p",
               mean.ci = TRUE, 
               pairwise.comparisons = TRUE, 
               pairwise.display = "s",
               p.adjust.method = "fdr",
               messages = FALSE)
```


## 6.3 Significant Test of Correlation

ggscatterstats() is used to build a visual for Significant Test of Correlation between Maths scores and English scores.

```{r}
ggscatterstats(data = exam_data,
               x = MATHS,
               y = ENGLISH,
               marginal = FALSE)
```

## 6.4 Significant Test of Association

Maths scores is binned into a 4-class variable by using cut().
ggbarstats() is used to build a visual for Significant Test of Association

```{r}
exam1 <- exam_data %>% 
  mutate(MATHS_bins = cut(MATHS, breaks = c(0,60,75,85,100)))

ggbarstats(exam1, x = MATHS_bins, y = GENDER)
```

# 7. Uncertainty of point estimates

## 7.1 ggplot2

A **point estimate** is a single number, such as a mean. **Uncertainty**, on the other hand, is expressed as **standard error**, **confidence interval**, or credible interval.

::: panel-tabset

### Data Transformation

`group_by()` of dplyr package groups the observation by RACE, `summarise()` compute the count of observations, mean, standard deviation. `mutate()` derive standard error of Maths by RACE, and the output is save as a tibble data table called `my_sum`.

```{r}
my_sum <- exam_data %>%
  group_by(RACE) %>%
  summarise(n=n(),
            mean=mean(MATHS),
            sd=sd(MATHS)) %>%
  mutate(se=sd/sqrt(n-1))
glimpse(my_sum)
```
### Table

We can view `my_sum` tibble data frame in an html table format.
Need DT

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(my_sum), format = 'html')
```

### Standard Error

We will plot the standard error bars of mean Maths Score by RACE. The error bars are computed by using the formula **mean+/-se**. For geom_point(), it is important to indicate `stat = “identity”`.

```{r}
ggplot(my_sum) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(x=RACE, 
                    ymin=mean-se, 
                    ymax=mean+se), 
                width=0.2, 
                colour="black", 
                alpha=0.9, 
                size=0.5) +
  geom_point(aes(x=RACE, y=mean), 
             stat="identity", 
             color="red",
             size = 1.5,
             alpha=1) +
  ggtitle("Standard error of mean Maths Score by Race")+
  theme_minimal()
```


### Confidence Interval

We can also plot the confidence intervals of mean Maths Score by RACE. The confidence intervals are computed by using the formula **mean+/-1.96*se**. The error bars are sorted by using the average maths scores.

```{r}
ggplot(my_sum) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(x=reorder(RACE, -mean), 
                    ymin=mean-1.96*se, 
                    ymax=mean+1.96*se), 
                width=0.2, 
                colour="black", 
                alpha=0.9, 
                size=0.5) +
  geom_point(aes(x=RACE, y=mean), 
             stat="identity", 
             color="red",
             size = 1.5,
             alpha=1) +
  labs(x = "Maths Score",
       title = "95% confidence interval of mean Maths Score by Race")+
  theme_minimal()
```

### Interactive Error Bars

We will plot interactive error bars for the 99% confidence interval of mean Maths Score by Race.

Need plotly and crosstalk

```{r}
# shared_df = SharedData$new(my_sum)

bscols(widths = c(4,8),
       ggplotly((ggplot(my_sum) +
                   geom_errorbar(aes(
                     x=reorder(RACE, -mean),
                     ymin=mean-2.58*se, 
                     ymax=mean+2.58*se), 
                     width=0.2, 
                     colour="black", 
                     alpha=0.9, 
                     size=0.5) +
                   geom_point(aes(
