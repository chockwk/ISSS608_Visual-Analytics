# 1. Learning Objectives

R is capable of reading data from most formats, such as csv, xlsx, or txt and include files created in other statistical packages, such as SAS, Stata, SPSS.

R also has two native data formats - rdata (also known as **rda**) for multiple R objects and **rds** for a single R object. These formats are used when R objects are saved for later use.

-   Load various statistical data formats using `haven` package
-   Manage large dataset using .gitignore file and "#\| eval: false"

# 2. R Package: Haven

`Haven` enables R to read and write various data formats used by other statistical packages by wrapping the ReadStat C library. `Haven` is part of the tidyverse and supports:

-   **SAS**: `read_sas()` reads `.sas7bdat` and `.sas7bcat` files while `read_xpt()` reads SAS transport files and `write_xpt()` writes SAS transport files.
-   **SPSS**: `read_sav()` reads `.sav` files and `read_por()` reads the older `.por` files. `write_sav()` writes `.sav` files.
-   **Stata**: `read_dta()` reads `.dta` files. `write_dta()` writes `.dta` files.

# 3. Load Packages

The following R packages will be used in this topic:

-   `tidyverse` is a family of R packages designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs
-   `haven` import common statistical formats into R via the embedded 'ReadStat' C library

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, haven)
```

# 4. Import Data

The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is a global education survey conducted every three years to **assess the education systems worldwide** through testing 15 year-old students in the subjects of mathematics, reading, and science. The current dataset was released on December 5, 2022.

Source: [PISA 2022](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/2022database/)

[`read_sas()`](https://haven.tidyverse.org/reference/read_sas.html) imports the PISA data into R environment.

```{r}
#| eval: false

stu_qqq <- read_sas("data/STU_QQQ_SAS/cy08msp_stu_qqq.sas7bdat")
```

The output shows **613,744 observations** with **1,279 variables**. The tibble dataframe contains descriptions for each variable, which is unavailable if `read.sas()` is used.

::: callout-note
To manage work space and render speed, Prof Kam recommends to avoid loading data into Github or datasets not exceeding 100 MB. We add the following text, data/, to .gitignore file for the exclusion of data folder.
:::

For relevance, we filter `stu_qqq` by the column `country code (CNT)` for *SGP* to obtain Singapore results.

```{r}
#| eval: false
stu_qqq_SGP <- stu_qqq %>% 
  filter(CNT == "SGP")
```

The output shows **6,606 observations** with **1,279 variables**.

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Save Point

```{r}
#| eval: false
write_rds(stu_qqq_SGP, "data/stu_qqq_SGP.rds")
```
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Load Point

```{r}
stu_qqq_SGP <-read_rds("data/stu_qqq_SGP.rds")
```
:::

```{r}
head(stu_qqq_SGP, n = 5)
```
