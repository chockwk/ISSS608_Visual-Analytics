# 1. Learning Objectives

-   Build a static ternary plot using `ggtern` package and an interactive ternary plot using `plotly` package

ggtern is a package that extends the functionality of ggplot2, giving the capability to plot ternary diagrams for (subset of) the ggplot2 proto geometries. Ternary diagrams are used frequently in a number of disciplines to graph compositional features for mixtures of three different elements or compounds. It is possible to represent a coordinate system having three (3) degrees of freedom, in 2D space, since the third dimention is linear and depends only on the other two.
